## About

**Band Heart Rate Monitor** is a Tauri-based desktop heart rate monitoring application that receives real-time heart rate data from wearable devices via the standard BLE Heart Rate Service (UUID 0x180D). It also includes a built-in web server that can be used as an OBS live stream overlay.

You need to enable the heart rate broadcast function in your wearable device's settings.

> 💡 Latest builds can be downloaded from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Roxy-0304/band-heart-rate/releases) page.

## ✨ Features

- **Tauri Desktop App** — Keeps collecting data in the background when the window is closed
- **Real-time Heart Rate Display** — Large digits with real-time refresh
- **Heart Rate Zone Detection** — Automatically identifies Warmup / Fat Burn / Aerobic / Limit zones with color-coded indicators
- **Live Statistics** — Automatically tracks min / max / average heart rate, with one-click reset
- **Connection Status** — Shows Connected / Scanning / Disconnected and Bluetooth error states
- **System Tray** — Minimises to tray when window is closed, click tray icon to restore
- **Web Server** — Can be used as an OBS live stream overlay, transparent background, supports custom CSS
- **Auto Reconnect** — Automatically scans and reconnects when the device disconnects, with exponential backoff
- **Cross-platform** — Windows, MacOS, Linux

---

## 🖥️ Dual Interface

The program provides two independent interfaces that work simultaneously:

### Desktop App (Tauri)

The main interface with full interactive experience:

- Large real-time heart rate display
- Heart rate zone color badges (Warmup / Fat Burn / Aerobic / Limit)
- Min / Max / Average statistics panel
- Reset statistics button
- System tray icon: right-click to show window or quit
- **Closing the window does NOT exit the app** — the app continues collecting data in the background
- Click tray "Show Window" to rebuild the interface and automatically retrieve the latest heart rate data

### Web Server (OBS)

Used for OBS live stream overlays. Default address:

```
http://127.0.0.1:3030
```

(Automatically switches to a random available port if 3030 is occupied. Check the startup message for the actual address.)

Web page features:
- Designed for **1920x1080** resolution, suitable for fullscreen display
- **Transparent background** — can be overlaid directly onto live streams without a green screen

**Custom Styles:**

```css
:root {
  --red: #00FF00;   /* Change to green */
}
```

### Heart Rate Zones

Zones are automatically calculated as a percentage of **maximum heart rate** (default reference: `220 - 30 = 190`):

| Zone | Range | Color | Description |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| 🟦 Warmup | 0%–60% | Blue `#4FC3F7` | Low intensity, suitable for warming up |
| 🟩 Fat Burn | 60%–70% | Green `#66BB6A` | Moderate intensity, optimal fat burning |
| 🟧 Aerobic | 70%–80% | Orange `#FFA726` | High intensity aerobic, improves cardiovascular fitness |
| 🟥 Limit | 80%–100% | Red `#EF5350` | Very high intensity, anaerobic endurance training |

---

## 📺 OBS Live Stream Overlay Setup

1. Run the program and ensure the Web UI is accessible
2. In OBS, click `+` → **Browser** to add a browser source
3. Configure the source properties:
   - **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:3030`
   - **Width**: `1920`
   - **Height**: `1080`
4. Click OK to finish

The page has a transparent background by default — no chroma key or green screen setup needed.

---

## 📦 Quick Start

### Download Pre-built Binary

1. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Roxy-0304/band-heart-rate/releases)
2. Download the latest `band-heart-rate.exe` (or the executable for your platform)
3. Run it directly

### Build from Source

**Requirements:**

- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (recommended via rustup)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for compiling the frontend TypeScript)

**Build steps:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Roxy-0304/band-heart-rate.git
cd band-heart-rate

# Install frontend dependencies and build
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# The executable is at target/release/band-heart-rate.exe
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

1. Enable **Heart Rate Broadcast** in your **band/watch settings**
2. Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your device
3. Run the program
4. The program will automatically scan for nearby heart rate broadcasting devices and connect
5. Heart rate data will be displayed in real-time on the desktop interface, and you can also access the Web UI in your browser
6. **Close window**: the app continues collecting data in the system tray
7. **Restore window**: click tray "Show Window" or re-launch the program
8. **Exit completely**: right-click tray icon → Quit

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MIBAND_ALLOWED_DEVICES` | Comma-separated device name keywords for allowed connections (case-insensitive) | `band,amazfit,watch,mi` |

**Example:**

```bash
# Only allow devices containing "mi" or "honor"
set MIBAND_ALLOWED_DEVICES=mi,honor
band-heart-rate.exe
```
